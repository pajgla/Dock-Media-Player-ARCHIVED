Hi all!

I made a huge mistake by sharing the old, pre-release repository instead of the main one which you can find here:

https://github.com/pajgla/Gnome-Dock-Media-Player

The widget has changed a lot from the last commit from this repository and many issues are already fixed there!
Sorry again!
